# RaylibTests
This project is just me experimenting aroudn Raylib and C/C++ most of them are just for tech demo purposes and maybe mini-mini-mini games 🤣

### Why the freak is it structured this way?

> With great project comes lazyness! 😉

I just initiated git in wrong folder 🤷🏻‍♂️ that's all......
